# Getting Started with the project

If you like this starter template and find it useful, please star this project. You're free to contribute to this if you feel you can add value to the starter template for other use-cases or if you want anything more to this documentation. I wrote this documentation in 5 minutes so I'm sure it can be improve. This is a very basic and generic starter template so you can use it in your personal project by modifying it as you like. 

## Setup

In the directory of your choice, run the following command to clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/FuzzySid/react-chrome-extension-manifest-v3.git`

Then, install all the node modules:

`npm i`

Then create a development build using:

`npm run start`

Builds the app for development to the `dev` folder in the root directory. Head over to chrome://extensions, toggle developer mode and upload the `dev` directory by clicking on the Load Unpacked button. After that, the chrome extension should be installed on your browser.
